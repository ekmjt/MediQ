MediQueue Conversational AI Triage System

Overview:
MediQueue is a conversational AI application that helps streamline the hospital triage process from the comfort of a patient’s home.

Process Details:

At-Home Triage Assessment:

Patients use the MediQueue portal on their phone or laptop to answer a series of questions.

The AI determines the severity of their condition and assigns an initial priority level.

Balancing Severity and Wait Time:

The system dynamically balances medical urgency with how long a patient has been waiting.

This ensures fair queue management by giving proportional weight to both factors.

Providing Initial Home Guidance:

MediQueue offers initial advice on what the patient can do at home while waiting, like simple first aid steps.

It also checks in periodically (e.g., every 30 minutes) to ensure the patient’s condition is stable.

Dynamic Queue Management:

The queue updates in real time as patients are added or removed, maintaining a dynamic balance between severity and waiting time.

User-Initiated Queue Position Change:

Users have the option to voluntarily lower their position in the queue if they realize they’ll be running late or if their condition is less urgent.

This allows them to give others a chance and helps keep the queue fair and flexible.

Preventing Queue Misuse:

If a user has previously misrepresented their condition, the AI will note this and confirm with them on future visits to ensure honesty.

Continued misuse may lead to manual triage at the hospital.
