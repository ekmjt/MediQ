MediQueue Conversational AI Triage System

Overview:
MediQueue is a conversational AI application designed to streamline the hospital triage process before a patient even arrives at the emergency room.

Process Details:

At-Home Triage Assessment:

Patients access the MediQueue portal on their phone or laptop from home.

The AI asks a series of guided questions to determine the severity of the user's condition—ranging from potentially life-threatening emergencies to minor issues.

Based on responses, the system assigns a priority level.

Balancing Severity and Wait Time:

The app not only prioritizes by medical urgency but also factors in how long someone has already been waiting.

It creates a proportional weighting system so that those who have waited longer are not overlooked, even if their condition is less severe.

Providing Initial Home Guidance:

While waiting or preparing to go to the hospital, the AI offers preliminary advice on steps the user can take at home—like basic first aid measures—until they reach the ER.

The system checks in with the user periodically (e.g., every 30 minutes or an hour) to ensure their condition hasn’t worsened.

Dynamic Queue Management:

The queue is dynamic, adjusting in real-time as new patients are added or existing patients are reassessed.

This ensures a fair balance between urgency and wait time.

Preventing Queue Misuse:

To prevent misuse, if a user has previously falsely escalated their condition to jump the queue, the system will note that.

On future visits, the AI will politely confirm with the user to ensure they are not repeating the behavior.

If misuse continues, the app can flag that user and require manual triage at the hospital.
